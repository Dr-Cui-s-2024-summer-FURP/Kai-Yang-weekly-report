# Week5: Learning point clouds and repruduct pointnet++

## Challenges
- Irregular: dense region and sparse region
- Unstructured
- Unordered

## permutation invariance
The order of the point clouds do not matter, but it matters when the point clouds are represented by a matrix struture.

## Structureed grid
- Voxel based
- multiview based


## In deep learning
